REACT WEATHER APP

This my first React app, trying to create a web app that consumes a weatrher api and displays the values on the screen,
(currently I've failed on that purpose).

The original tutorial is on YT:

You can also fork the original project from Hamza Mirza here:

Well... if happens that you clone my noobie project and does not works, BUT you can make it work while I still learning, 
please share your comments...

I'm pretty new on React, just started today a few hours ago  ;)

REGARDS!

Happy coding.
